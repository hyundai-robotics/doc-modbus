# 3.2 Setting the Controller

By setting up the controller, you can configure a Modbus master query and send it to a slave. You can transmit and receive data periodically by setting a scan rate. Through the settings, you can set the master and slave one-to-one.

You can set the Modbus master in the **\[Setting > 2: Control parameter > Modbus]** screen according to the communication method.

If the set parameter is not shown, check the Start and Status data in the **\[Service> 10: App > Main]** screen before performing the operation.
